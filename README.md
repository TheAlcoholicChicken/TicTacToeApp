# Installation
Pre-requisites: Node.js and Mongo downloaded

1. Open cmd prompt and go to project folder
2. 'npm install'
3. 'npm start' to start server

This will install everything in the packages.json file. This will make the node module folder that is specified in the .gitignore.

Open localhost:3000 to view the APP.
localhost:3000/newuser  to register yourself in the database.  
If success, it will take you to localhost:3000/userlist and you should be able to see yourself on there.

Make sure to restart Node anytime a change is made in the javascript. No need for Jade, just refresh the page.
